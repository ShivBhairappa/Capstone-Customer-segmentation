# Customer Segmentation

Research Question:
How can customer segmentation based on purchasing patterns, demographics, and engagement levels improve personalized marketing and customer experience for an e-commerce platform?

Expected Data Source(s):
The data will be sourced from the e-commerce platform’s internal databases, including customer demographic profiles, transaction logs (purchase history), and web analytics tools capturing user engagement metrics such as time on site, page views, and click-through rates.

Expected Data Structure:

Customer Demographics: Structured tabular data with fields such as customer ID, age, gender, and location.
Purchase History: Transactional records including customer ID, transaction dates, frequency, order values, and total spending.
Website Engagement: Web session data containing metrics like session duration, pages visited, and click-through rate.
Techniques to Be Used:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To reduce dimensionality and isolate key behavioral features.
K-Means Clustering: To identify primary customer segments based on shared behavioral traits.
DBSCAN: To detect less common, niche, or anomalous customer groups that traditional clustering might overlook.
Expected Results:
The project will yield distinct customer segments that reflect common patterns in shopping behavior and engagement. These segments will allow marketing teams to tailor strategies, optimize user experience, and allocate resources more effectively.

Why This Question Is Important:
In a competitive digital marketplace, generic marketing fails to meet diverse customer needs. Without understanding customer subgroups, businesses risk inefficiencies in advertising, product recommendations, and user engagement. This project delivers actionable insights by identifying meaningful customer segments, empowering marketing and product teams to personalize experiences and boost retention, satisfaction, and ultimately, revenue. This segmentation framework supports data-driven decisions that bridge the gap between raw behavioral data and practical business intelligence, which is accessible even to non-technical stakeholders.

The dataset contains several CSV files, likely covering different aspects of the e-commerce business:

1. **Amazon Sale Report.csv** – Possibly sales from Amazon as a sales channel.
2. **Cloud Warehouse Comparison Chart.csv** – Looks unrelated to customer segmentation (infrastructure-related).
3. **Expense IIGF.csv** – Likely expense data, may not be central to customer segmentation.
4. **International Sale Report.csv** – International sales data.
5. **May-2022.csv** – Monthly data for May 2022.
6. **P & L March 2021.csv** – Profit and loss statement.
7. **Sale Report.csv** – General sales report.

### Next Steps:

1. Load and inspect **Amazon Sale Report.csv**, **International Sale Report.csv**, **May-2022.csv**, and **Sale Report.csv** for customer and transaction data.
2. Identify fields for **Customer Demographics**, **Purchase History**, and **Engagement metrics** (if available).
3. Prepare the data for PCA, K-Means, and DBSCAN clustering.



***Load and preview all relevant CSV files** now to identify useful columns



**Summary of the relevant CSV files and columns**

---

### **1. Amazon Sale Report.csv** (128,975 rows × 24 columns)

* **Contains:** Transactional sales records with customer shipping info.
* **Key columns:**

  * `Order ID`, `Date`, `Status`, `Sales Channel`, `Qty`, `Amount`
  * Customer location: `ship-city`, `ship-state`, `ship-country`, `ship-postal-code`
  * Product info: `Category`, `SKU`, `Style`, `Size`
* **Use:** Purchase history & demographic (geographic) segmentation.

---

### **2. International sale Report.csv** (37,432 rows × 10 columns)

---

### **3. May-2022.csv** (1,330 rows × 17 columns)

* **Contains:** Pricing and product catalog.
* **Key columns:**

  * `Sku`, `Category`, `TP` (transfer price?), `MRP`, channel-specific MRPs (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)
* **Use:** Product metadata and pricing insights (not direct customer info).

---

### **4. Sale Report.csv** (9,271 rows × 7 columns)

* **Contains:** Stock and product information.
* **Key columns:**

  * `SKU Code`, `Category`, `Size`, `Stock`, `Color`
* **Use:** Product-level attributes; can be merged with sales for better context.

---

### Initial Insights:

* **Customer Demographics:** Can be derived from `ship-city`, `ship-state`, `ship-country` (Amazon Sale Report).
* **Purchase History:** Amazon Sale Report and International sale Report hold order-level transaction data.
* **Engagement Data:** Not explicitly present; we may infer engagement from frequency, recency, and quantity of purchases.

---

### Next Steps:

1. **Combine Amazon and International sales data** into a unified transaction table (normalize columns).
2. Enrich with **product attributes** from Sale Report and May-2022.csv.
3. Build features for:

   * Recency, Frequency, Monetary value (RFM)
   * Location, product preferences
4. Prepare for **PCA**, **K-Means**, and **DBSCAN**.

---
 **start cleaning and merging the Amazon & International sales datasets** into a single customer-transaction table (with derived features for segmentation)


We have successfully **merged Amazon and International sales datasets** into a unified table with **166,407 transaction records**.

### Current Unified Dataset:

* Columns:

  * `order_id` (Amazon only)
  * `date` (transaction date)
  * `city`, `state`, `country`, `postal_code` (geo info from Amazon only)
  * `quantity` (number of items purchased)
  * `amount` (transaction value)
  * `category` (product category)
  * `sku` (product code)
  * `source` (Amazon or International)
* Issues to fix:

  1. **Data Types:** `quantity` and `amount` are stored as `object` and need to be numeric.
  2. **Date parsing:** `date` is still in string format.
  3. **Missing customer identifiers:** International data uses `customer_name`, but Amazon data does not have names (only address info).
  4. **Missing values:** Many fields are missing (especially demographics for international customers).

---

### Next Steps:

1. **Clean data types and handle missing values.**
2. **Derive customer-level features:** Recency, frequency, total spend (RFM), locations, categories purchased, etc.
3. Aggregate transactions **per customer or per shipping address** for segmentation.


**Clean data and build RFM features (customer-level)**



Successfully cleaned the dataset and built **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features** for customer-level segmentation.

### **RFM Features**

* **Recency:** Days since the customer's last purchase (lower is better).
* **Frequency:** Total number of transactions.
* **Monetary:** Total spend (₹) across all transactions.

### **Top Customers (by total spend)**:

1. **NOIDA\_201301** – Recency: 2 days, Frequency: 821 orders, Monetary: ₹534,179.72
2. **GURUGRAM\_122001** – Recency: 1 day, Frequency: 552 orders, Monetary: ₹359,885.66
3. **BENGALURU\_560068** – Recency: 1 day, Frequency: 530 orders, Monetary: ₹332,686.81

> This clearly shows high-value repeat customers.

---

### Next Steps:

1. **Normalize RFM features** for clustering.
2. Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.
3. Cluster using **K-Means** (primary segmentation) and **DBSCAN** (to detect niche groups).

 **proceed with PCA and K-Means clustering** on the RFM dataset


The **Elbow Method** plot is now available: it helps us choose the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-Means.

From the graph:

* WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) decreases sharply until **k ≈ 4 or 5**, after which it flattens out.

---

### Next Steps:

1. Choose **k = 4 or 5** clusters.
2. Run **K-Means clustering** with the chosen `k`.
3. Visualize the clusters in PCA space and analyze customer segments.

 **proceed with k = 4 and 5 clusters for segmentation

The **K-Means clustering** has been successfully reprocessed for both **k=4** and **k=5** clusters.

### **Cluster Characteristics (K=4)**:

| Cluster | Recency (days) | Frequency (#orders) | Monetary (₹)  |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| 0       | **Lower**      | Medium              | Medium        |
| 1       | High           | Low                 | Low           |
| 2       | Medium         | Medium              | Medium        |
| 3       | **Very Low**   | **Very High**       | **Very High** |

### **Cluster Characteristics (K=5)**:

* Splits the medium-value customers further into 2 distinct subgroups with slightly different spend and frequency patterns.

---

### Insights:

* **Cluster 3 (K=4)** is the "VIP" segment (low recency, very high frequency & spend).
* **Cluster 1 (K=4)** is the least engaged group (high recency, low spend).
* **K=5** provides slightly more granular segmentation but may overcomplicate the marketing strategy.

---

### Next Steps:

1. Build a **DBSCAN** model to detect niche or anomalous customers.
2. Finalize **segment profiles** (e.g., VIP, high potential, at risk, inactive).
3. Prepare **recommendations for personalized marketing**.

 **Running DBSCAN clustering** next to capture niche/anomalous customers


Run the full pipeline (including K-Means results for reference) along with DBSCAN

**Full pipeline results** (K-Means and DBSCAN):

---

### **K-Means (k=4)** Segment Profiles:

| Cluster | Recency (days) | Frequency (#orders) | Monetary (₹)  |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **0**   | Medium         | Medium              | Medium        |
| **1**   | High           | Low                 | Low           |
| **2**   | Medium-High    | Medium              | Medium-Low    |
| **3**   | **Very Low**   | **Very High**       | **Very High** |

> **Cluster 3** = "VIP / High Value" customers (frequent, high spend, recently active).
> **Cluster 1** = "At-Risk" or inactive customers.

---

### **K-Means (k=5)** adds finer granularity:

* Splits mid-tier customers into **two distinct segments** based on spending & frequency.
* Good if you want **more targeted marketing** campaigns, but slightly more complex.

---

### **DBSCAN Clusters (Niche/Anomalous Customers)**:

* **Cluster `-1` (Noise):** Customers that don't fit any clear group – likely outliers or niche buyers.
* Other clusters (`0`, `1`, `2`, ...) are small, dense groups of customers with **very similar RFM patterns**.
* **Cluster counts:**

  * `-1` (outliers): Largest group (\~majority of data)
  * Small niche groups (0–3): 10–50 customers each

---

### Key Takeaways:

1. **K-Means:** Ideal for defining broad customer segments for personalization.
2. **DBSCAN:** Helps detect **niche, anomalous, or extremely loyal / inactive clusters**.

   * Useful for special campaigns (e.g., reactivation, VIP recognition).

**Label and profile the final customer segments** (VIP, At-Risk, New, Mid-Tier, Niche)


The session reset again, and we lost the data.

To avoid this, I will now **directly summarize the customer segment profiles (from our previous runs)** based on the labels we derived:

---

### **Final Customer Segment Labels (K-Means, k=4)**

1. **VIP / High Value (Cluster 3)**

   * **Recency:** Very low (recent buyers)
   * **Frequency:** Very high (frequent shoppers)
   * **Monetary:** Very high total spend
   * **Strategy:** Priority segment – early access to sales, loyalty rewards, personalized recommendations.

2. **At Risk / Inactive (Cluster 1)**

   * **Recency:** High (haven’t purchased in a long time)
   * **Frequency:** Low
   * **Monetary:** Low
   * **Strategy:** Reactivation campaigns – discounts, win-back emails, reminders.

3. **Mid-Tier Active (Cluster 0)**

   * **Recency:** Medium
   * **Frequency:** Medium
   * **Monetary:** Medium
   * **Strategy:** Cross-sell and upsell campaigns to move them into VIP segment.

4. **New / Occasional (Cluster 2)**

   * **Recency:** Medium-High (somewhat recent)
   * **Frequency:** Low-to-medium
   * **Monetary:** Medium-low
   * **Strategy:** Welcome campaigns, nurture to build loyalty.

---

### **DBSCAN: Niche / Anomalous Customers**

* **Cluster `-1` (Noise):** Customers that don't fit into any main group. Could be one-time bargain shoppers or unique high spenders.
* Small dense clusters (e.g., 0, 1, 2): represent niche behaviors like **bulk seasonal buyers** or **single product category loyalists**.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. Use **VIP** & **Mid-Tier** segments for **loyalty programs & upselling**.
2. Target **At-Risk** customers with **reactivation offers**.
3. Nurture **New/Occasional** customers with **education, product suggestions & onboarding campaigns**.
4. Investigate **niche DBSCAN clusters** to find unique behaviors (e.g., bulk buyers or category loyalists).
